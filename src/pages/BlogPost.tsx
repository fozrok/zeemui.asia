            <h2>Can Foreigners Buy Luxury Property in Thailand?</h2>
            <p>
              The easy answer is 'yes!' However, you cannot directly own the freehold land in your personal name if you are a foreigner. Although, the building structure can always be legally owned and registered in a foreigner's personal name, whereas the freehold Chanote land title must be registered at the land office in a Thai person or in a Limited Thai company name.
            </p>

            <h2>So how can I buy a Luxury Home in Thailand safely as a foreigner?</h2>
            <p>
              Whilst Property Ownership Laws may seem frustrating at the start, they are in fact put in place mainly to protect the real estate market from over-development, to retain the country's natural beauty, and also to keep property & land prices within easy reach of local Thai nationals.
            </p>
            <p>When you look at it in this way... it sounds fair enough!</p>
            <p>
              How would you feel as a first time buyer in your own country of residence if you were unable to afford to buy a property due to inflated property prices from overseas investment?
            </p>
            <p>
              This has already become the case in many more over-developed places around the world, such as London, San Fransisco, Singapore or Hong Kong.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              Home ownership within Thailand is very high at over 80%! Compared to places such as United Kingdom at 63.5% or USA at 64.5%.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              At a first glance these strict ownership laws might seem like a disappointing discovery, but if you dig a little deeper and you find various viable and reliable options for Foreigners to Purchase Luxury Property in Thailand are still available.
            </p>
            <p>If your dream is to own a Luxury Villa in Thailand don't despair just yet...</p>
            <p>
              Purchasing Luxury Real Estate in Thailand as a foreigner is still safe and possible, and we have listed the top 5 options for you!
            </p>

            <h2>1. Buying a Luxury Condominium</h2>
            <p>This is one of the easiest methods for Foreigners to Buy Real Estate in Thailand.</p>
            <p>
              The 1979 'Thai Condominium Act' permits foreigners to own the freehold of up to 49% of the total unit space in a Condominium project.
            </p>
            <p>
              i.e., if there are 100 equal-sized condominiums in a project, 49 would be available for foreigners to own, with their personal name on the title deed/' Condominium Chanote' (*Note: is worth doing your due diligence and research, as some regions in Thailand for example Koh Samui have now prohibited the new building of condominium projects.)
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The remaining 51% of units would be available for Thai nationals only to purchase.</li>
              <li>A letter of guarantee of the "foreign quota" along with certificate of debt-free assurance (indicating there is no outstanding common area fees relating to the unit) must also be presented to the Land Department upon the transfer of property ownership.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Leasing a Luxury Property or Land in Thailand</h2>
            <p>Another clear-cut option available to foreigners is to lease an apartment or piece of land.</p>
            <blockquote>
              A leasehold is effectively a pre-paid rental agreement - whereby you secure the property or land price ahead of time.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              A foreigner can easily and legally lease property or land in their own personal name for an initial 30 years with the land department in Thailand - this is the maximum single tenure.
            </p>
            <p>
              However according to the Civil and Commercial Code, the property lease can also be potentially be renewed for a further 2 consecutive times, therefore allowing a total combined leasehold period of up to 90 years.
            </p>

            <h3>What is a secured leasehold option?</h3>
            <p>
              This is often referred to as "collective freehold"; whereby the owners of an apartment building or project also own and control the freehold of the whole project by owning shares proportionate to their investment registered in an off-sure company, which in-turn controls the main Thai freehold of the land.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Buying Land Through a Company</h2>
            <p>
              There are many different Land Title Options available within the Thai Real Estate market, and it sometimes seem at the start quite confusing.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              One way to control the 'Chanote' freehold title is via a Thai Limited Company, which can legally purchase land in Thailand.
            </blockquote>

            <h2>4. BOI Investment</h2>
            <p>
              This unique type of Property Ownership Option in Thailand is more uncommon for a residential purchase, but it is still possible option for investors of Luxury Villas for Sale and Resorts for sale in Thailand.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Foreign Husband & Thai Spouse</h2>
            <p>
              A foreigner can legally Purchase Land for Sale in Thailand if he or she is married to a Thai national. This may sound obvious, but it is certainly not something to rush into - just like overseas investment, it is recommended you take your time to get to know and trust your Thai partner before putting your Luxury Property asset in their name.
            </p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
              In conclusion there are many different ways for Foreigners to Buy Real Estate in Thailand, but these restrictions are for the security of the property market and purchasers too.
